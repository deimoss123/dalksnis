This is an "economy" bot for the chatting platform Discord, where users can trade with eachother, play games and participate in various activities. Although I call it an "economy bot", it's more of a text based multiplayer adventure game.

<br />
Currently the bot is in 110+ Discord servers and at its peak had over 100 monthly
active users.

## Item system

There are 40+ unique items to acquire in the bot, each with their own uses and behaviors.

<br />
Here is an example of a user's inventory

<CustomImage src={invImg} alt="A user's inventory" width={400} />
<br />

To acquire more valueble items, users must get them from the market (image below)

<CustomImage src={tirgusImg} alt="The market" width={400} />
<br />

These more valuable items require other items to be purchased, which leads players to trade with eachother.

## Gambling

While I do not encourage gambling, it's a loved activity of the users. Users can play slots, roulette and scratch loto tickets. Even though I have stated multiple times publicily that it's an incredibly unfair system. There are multiple people with thousands of spins in both slots and roulette.

<br />
Below you can see a roulette spin with 100 lati (the bot's virtual currency).

## Fishing system

Users can get fishing rods and catch various types of fish and other items.

There are other systems I haven't mentioned here as it would make this page very long. As of February 2024 I have decided to revive this project and make the biggest update to date. Hopefully I remember to update this page as well.
