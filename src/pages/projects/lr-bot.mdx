This is a bot for the chatting app Discord. Users can join voice channels and use this bot to listen to various Latvian radio stations.

<br />
Currently the bot is in 130+ Discord servers and is being used daily.

This was a project I made in one evening because a friend asked me to. However since then I have done a lot to improve and optimize it, and it has grown larger than I had ever imagined.

<br />
This project also introduced me to Docker, because I was having problems hosting
this on my VPS due to various issues with ffmpeg, so containerizing helped a lot.
